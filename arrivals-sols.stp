To convert the departure and arrival times to Mars time and date, we'll need to adjust for the difference in the length of a Martian day compared to an Earth day. A Martian day, or sol, is approximately 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds long.

Let's assume the departure and arrival times are adjusted accordingly:

| Conjunction Number | Date of Conjunction | Departure from Earth (Earth time) | Arrival at Mars (Earth time) | Departure from Earth (Mars time) | Arrival at Mars (Mars time) |
|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
