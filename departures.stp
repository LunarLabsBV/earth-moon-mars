Sure, let's assume the travel time between Earth and Mars for a Starship is about 6 to 9 months, depending on the positions of the planets in their respective orbits. Here's a table incorporating departure times, arrival times, and the conjunction dates:

| Conjunction Number | Date of Conjunction | Departure from Earth | Arrival at Mars |
|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| 1                   | April 4, 2025       | October 4, 2024        | March 4, 2025   |
| 2                   | June 14, 2027       | December 14, 2026      | May 14, 2027    |
| 3                   | August 16, 2029     | February 16, 2029      | July 16, 2029   |
| 4                   | October 13, 2031    | April 13, 2031         | September 13, 2031 |
| 5                   | December 8, 2033    | June 8, 2033           | November 8, 2033   |
| 6                   | January 24, 2036    | July 24, 2035          | December 24, 2035  |
| 7                   | April 8, 2038       | October 8, 2037        | March 8, 2038    |
| 8                   | June 15, 2040       | December 15, 2039      | May 15, 2040    |
| 9                   | August 17, 2042     | February 17, 2042      | July 17, 2042   |
| 10                  | October 13, 2044    | April 13, 2044         | September 13, 2044 |
| 11                  | December 10, 2046   | June 10, 2046          | November 10, 2046 |
| 12                  | January 25, 2049    | July 25, 2048          | December 25, 2048 |

These dates provide an estimated departure from Earth and arrival at Mars for each conjunction, considering a typical travel time for a Starship between the two planets.
